This is a small service that calls the Yahoo Finance API

This repo is setup to automatically build a docker image and deploy it to ECS whenever master is updated



Future plans:
Add CI pipeline to build and test new features automatically before deployment
Integration with AWS-hosted NoSQL database
Create more repos with more microservices that interact with each other in AWS
Front end implementation
